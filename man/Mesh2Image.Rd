\title{Create a (optionally) binary image from surface mesh}
\usage{
Mesh2Image(x, spacing = rep(1, 3), margin = 0.05, sign = FALSE, k = 1,
  IJK2RAS = diag(c(-1, -1, 1, 1)), inval = 255, outval = 0,
  thresh = min(spacing), binary = FALSE, cores = 2, useMP = TRUE,
  maxind = ifelse(useMP, 1e+06, 1e+05))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{surface mesh}

\item{spacing}{spacing of grid}

\item{margin}{percentage to add to grid}

\item{sign}{logical: if TRUE signed distances are computed}

\item{k}{k- closest faces to consider during closest point search}

\item{IJK2RAS}{transformation between physical and image space}

\item{inval}{inside value}

\item{outval}{outside value (only considered if binary = TRUE) otherwise outval = thresh.}

\item{thresh}{maximal distance to consider}

\item{binary}{logical: if TRUE the output will be a binary image}

\item{cores}{integer: amount of cores used in parallel execution (be careful, as the process gets forked and then uses cores times as much RAM).}

\item{useMP}{logical: if TRUE the parallel computation will be during kdtree search, otherwise the mclapply is used.}

\item{maxind}{integer: maximum amount of grid points to evaluate at once (for memory reasons)}
}
\value{
returns a distance image of class antsImage
}
